					<h1 class="title-1">👩‍🎓 FIRST-DAY EXCITEMENT</h1>
					<p> As a Vietnamese international student starting my new life in Japan, my first day in the LLLP program was filled with excitement, nervousness, and endless curiosity. Everything felt new — the environment, the people, even the air. Yet, that sense of unfamiliarity only made me more eager to explore.
						Meeting peers from so many different backgrounds reminded me that real learning extends far beyond textbooks. It happens in small conversations, in shared experiences, and in seeing the world through someone else’s perspective. That first day, I realized I was stepping into a community where every story, every culture, and every moment would shape the way I learn and grow.
						It felt like the beginning of a journey not only about studying, but also about discovering who I am in a completely new place.

					<h1 class="title-2">👩‍🎓 OPENING CEREMONY</h1>
					<p> During the university’s opening ceremony, surrounded by flags, proud families, and the excitement of new students, I had a quiet moment to reflect on my own goals. I told myself that this year, I would step outside my comfort zone more often — even when it felt scary. I would embrace cultural exchange, meet new people, and learn to appreciate the beauty in Japan’s everyday life.
						As the speeches continued, I felt a growing sense of possibility. This wasn’t just the start of a program; it felt like the start of a new chapter of my life. A chapter filled with challenges, discoveries, friendships, and memories waiting to happen.
						In that moment, I knew that Week 1 wasn’t simply an introduction — it was the beginning of something much bigger than a course. It was the beginning of my own story in Japan.
