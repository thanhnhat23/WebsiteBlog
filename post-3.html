					<h1 class="title-1">📸 PHOTO FOR MY INSTA</h1>
					<p> To make things even more heartwarming, my sister gave me a bouquet in my favorite colors – pink and purple. I almost cried, but I didn’t want to ruin my eyeliner.
                        After our very full (and very emotional) meal, we visited the campus of my university (campus 2) nearby. Since it was the weekend, we couldn’t go inside, but I was blown away just looking at it. It looked more like a luxury hotel or a condo than a school. I seriously can’t wait to study there next semester.

					<h1 class="title-2">🌸 Blooming With the Season</h1>
					<p> Standing under the cherry blossoms felt almost magical — like the world slowed down for a moment. 
                        The air was cool, the petals were falling softly, and everything looked like a scene from a postcard. I felt peaceful and light, as if the season itself was welcoming me with open arms. Moments like this make me appreciate my life in Japan even more.</p>

					<h1 class="title-2">👀 A Day Out With My Friend</h1>
					<p> This picture captures the playful, chaotic energy of our shopping trips. We weren’t planning to buy much (as always), but somehow we ended up wandering around the store, trying random things, laughing at ourselves, and enjoying every second. It’s funny how ordinary days like this often become some of my favorite memories.</p>
