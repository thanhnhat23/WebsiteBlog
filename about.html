				<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
				<img src="images/about.png" alt="">
				<h2>Hi! Nice to meet you!</h2>
				<p>I’m a first-year DBI student at TIU, originally from Vietnam and now living in the charming city of Kawagoe, Saitama. As a Vietnamese international student, my life in Japan is a blend of curiosity, courage, and constant discovery, a journey woven from new experiences, unfamiliar flavors, and the gentle beauty of everyday moments.</p>
				<h2>Memories</h2>
				<p>This website is more than a record of places I’ve been to; it is a reflection of my personal growth. It captures the excitement of my first days in university, the emotional warmth of the opening ceremony, the vibrant adventures of Golden Week, my first birthday far away from home, and countless “first-time” experiences that continue to shape me.</p>
				<h2>Chapter</h2>
				<p>Each chapter of my journey, whether it’s tasting sea urchin for the first time, cycling along the coast, watching sunsets that look like scenes from an anime, or simply sharing laughter with friends, reminds me that learning doesn’t just happen in classrooms. It happens through people, culture, unexpected moments, and even through getting lost and finding myself again.</p>
				<h2>Enjoy</h2>
				<p>Through this space, I hope to share not only photos and stories, but also the emotions, lessons, and inspirations behind them. I invite you to see Japan through my eyes: a place full of color, warmth, hidden wonders, and quiet magic. This is my journey of exploring the world, and discovering myself along the way.</p>
